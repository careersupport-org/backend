The roadmap should be practical, modern, aligned with current industry standards as of {current_date}, and tailored to build upon their existing knowledge and experience.\n\n### PERSONALIZATION GUIDELINES\n\n1. **Gap Analysis**: Identify skill gaps between the user's current expertise and their target job requirements.\n\n2. **Leverage Strengths**: Build upon the user's existing knowledge and transferable skills from previous experiences.\n\n3. **Address Weaknesses**: Prioritize areas where the user needs the most development based on their background.\n\n4. **Learning Style Adaptation**: Consider the user's preferred learning methods and constraints mentioned in their instructions.\n\n5. **Career Context**: Tailor recommendations based on whether the user is transitioning careers, upskilling in their current role, or entering the field for the first time.\n\n### TECHNOLOGY SPECIFICITY REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **Concrete Technology Focus**: Each step in the roadmap MUST focus on specific, named technologies, frameworks, languages, or tools (like \"Java\", \"Spring\", \"React\", \"Docker\", \"Kubernetes\", \"PostgreSQL\") rather than abstract concepts (like \"Future Technologies\", \"Modern Frameworks\", or \"Advanced Computing\").\n\n2. **Version Specificity**: Where relevant, specify versions or edition details of technologies (e.g., \"Java 17\", \"Spring Boot 3.x\", \"React 18\").\n\n3. **Technical Ecosystem**: Group related technologies that are commonly used together to create a coherent learning path (e.g., \"Node.js + Express + MongoDB\" rather than just listing them separately).\n\n4. **Industry-Standard Stacks**: Prioritize technology combinations that are commonly used in production environments for the target job role.\n\n5. **Tool Specificity**: Include specific development tools, testing frameworks, and DevOps technologies that are essential for working with each stack.\n\n### FORMAT REQUIREMENTS\n\nPresent the roadmap as a JSON object following this exact structure:\n\n{format_instructions}\n\n### CONTENT GUIDELINES\n\n1. **Progressive Difficulty**: Ensure steps build upon each other, beginning with the user's current skill level and progressing to advanced concepts.\n\n2. **Modern Relevance**: Include current technologies, frameworks, and practices that are industry-standard as of {current_date} and relevant to the target job.\n\n3. **Practical Focus**: Each step should include actionable learning objectives and measurable outcomes that align with industry expectations for the target role.\n\n4. **Industry Alignment**: Ensure the skills and technologies emphasized align with what employers are specifically looking for in candidates for the {target_job} position.\n\n5. **tag_format** : Please write tags in English\n\nIMPORTANT: Please write in {language}\n\nNow, please create a detailed, personalized roadmap for this user to reach their {target_job} goal, taking into account their specific background, experience level, and stated preferences.\n",
